# This is a self created function to print sample spaces or events that have
# been created with the expand.grid() function. It can also detect if the event/
# sample space is empty, by printing the symbol for the empty space.
# It works by looping through the data frame
# and adding each row to the cat() function which is able to print and render
# latex and markdown commands properly only if used with the code chunk flag:
# " results = 'asis' ".
# To print a sample space simply call the function with the event/sample space
# you want to print and the name of the event/sample space:
# like this: print_samp_space(event_to_be_printed, name_of_event)
# remember to escape latex commands i.e. if you want to create an event/sample
# space called Omega you have to write " \\Omega " or if you want to write the
# intersection of A and B you have to write " A \\cap B ".
