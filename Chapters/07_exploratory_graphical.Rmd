# Exploratory data analysis - Graphical summaries

## Histograms

Histograms are useful graphical way of representing a data set and allows you to spot patterns that were otherwise not visible in the raw dataset.

Take for example this dataset of randomly generated numbers sampled from a normal distribution:
```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-1", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
data <- rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = .2)
data <- matrix(data, 10, 10, byrow = TRUE)
kable(data, format = "latex", booktabs = T,
  caption =
  "Randomly generated normal dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

Just staring at the dataset for a while tells us very little. To see something useful, we can plot it as a histogram:

Now this can be done in two ways:
1. Using the **base R** function `hist(data, ...)`
2. Using **ggplot2** to plot the histogram

### Base R `hist(data)`
To see all the available arguments that you can pass to the `hist()` function simply write `?hist` in the `R` console
```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-2"}
set.seed(1)
data <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = .2)
hist(data, col = "#f99d9d",
  main = "Histogram of normally distributed dataset")
```

### Plotting multiple histograms on one plot with `hist(data)`

To plot multiple histograms in with `Base R` one plot one can do as follows:
```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-3"}
#make this example reproducible
set.seed(1)

#define data
x1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = 0.2)
x2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0.4, sd = 0.1)

#plot two histograms in same graph
hist(x1, col = "red", xlim = c(0, 1.5),
    main = "Multiple Histograms", xlab = "x")
hist(x2, col = "green", add = TRUE)

#add legend
legend("topright", c("x1 variable", "x2 variable"), fill = c("red", "green"))
```

### ggplot2 `ggplot(data)`

Now to use `ggplot` to plot your data you have to first make it into a data frame:
```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-4"}
set.seed(1)
df <- data.frame(var = rep("x1", 1000),
          value = c(rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = .2)))
brx <- pretty(range(df$value),
    n = nclass.Sturges(df$value), min.n = 1)
    # the brx function is only used to make it look like the base R
    # hist function which uses 'Sturges rule' to determine binsize i.e, 'breaks'
    # the default binsize for geom_histogram is 30.
ggplot(df, aes(x = value, fill = var)) + geom_histogram(breaks = brx)
```

### Plotting multiple histograms on one plot with `ggplot(data)`

To plot multiple histograms in with `ggplot2` one plot one can do as follows:

```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-5"}
#make this example reproducible
set.seed(1)

#create data frame
df <- data.frame(var = c(rep("x1", 1000), rep("x2", 1000)),
                   value = c(rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = .2),
                             rnorm(1000, mean = 0.4, sd = 0.1)))

#plot multiple histograms
ggplot(df, aes(x = value, fill = var)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "#e9ecef", alpha = 0.6, position = "identity")
```

## Kernel density estimates

We can graphically represent data in a more variegated plot by a so-called
kernel density estimate.

The idea behind the construction of the plot is to “put a pile of sand” around
each element of the dataset. At places where the elements accumulate, the
sand will pile up. The actual plot is constructed by choosing a $kernel \ K$ and
a $bandwidth \ h$. 

The $kernel \ K$ reflects the shape of the piles of sand, whereas
the bandwidth is a tuning parameter that determines how wide the piles of sand will be.

Formally, a kernel $K$ is a function $K : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-6", echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Examples of well-known kernels $K$', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('Chapters', 'assets', 'kernel_density.png'))
```

To plot a kernel density estimate you can use either the `densityplot` function from the library `lattice` or you can use the **base R** function `plot` with the parameter `density()`.

For simplicity I will choose to use the **base R** function and using the diamonds dataset from the `UsingR`.
```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-7", message = FALSE}
library(UsingR)
```
```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-8", out.width = "100%", out.height="120%"}
kernels <- c("triangular", "rectangular", "gaussian", "cosine", "optcosine", "epanechnikov", "biweight")
colors <- brewer.pal(7, "Accent")
for (kernel in 1:7) {
  main <- "Kernel density estimates with different kernels"
  if (kernel == 1)
    plot(density(diamond$price, bw = 10000, kernel = "triangular",
    ), main = main, col = colors[kernel], lwd = 2)
  else
    lines(density(diamond$price, bw = 10000, kernel = kernels[kernel]), col = colors[kernel], lwd = 2)
}
legend('topright', kernels, fill = colors, cex = .7)
```

The `bw` argument specifes the bandwith that wil be used to create the kernel density estimate. The `kernel` argument specifies the kernel that will be used

## Empirical distribution function

Another way to graphically represent a dataset is to plot the data in a cumulative
manner. This can be done using the empirical cumulative distribution
function of the data.

In `R` this can be done like this:

```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-9"}
plot(ecdf(diamond$price), col = "#74c6ef")
```

## Scatterplot

In some situations one wants to investigate the relationship between two or
more variables. In the case of two variables $x$ and $y$, the dataset consists of
$pairs \ of \ observations$:
$$
(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots ,(x_n, y_n)
$$
We call such a dataset a bivariate dataset in contrast to the univariate dataset,
which consists of observations of one particular quantity. We often like to investigate
whether the value of variable y depends on the value of the variable $x$,
and if so, whether we can describe the relation between the two variables. A
first step is to take a look at the data, i.e., to plot the points $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, 2 \dots , n$. Such a plot is called a scatterplot.

In `R` this can be acheived by simply using the `plot()` function:

```{r "7_exploratory_graphical-10"}
#create some fake data
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11),
                   y = c(13, 14, 17, 12, 23, 24, 25, 25, 24, 28, 32, 33, 35, 40, 41))

#create scatterplot of data
plot(data$x, data$y)
```
