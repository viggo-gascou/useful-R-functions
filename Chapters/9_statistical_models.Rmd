## The linear regression model

To fit a linear regression model in `R`, we can use the `lm()` function, which uses the following syntax:

`model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data=df)`

We can then use the following syntax to use the model to predict a single value:

`predict(model, newdata = new)`

The following examples show how to predict a single value using fitted regression models in `R`.

### Simple linear regression model

The following code shows how to fit a simple linear regression model in R:

```{r}
#create data
df <- data.frame(x = c(3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12),
                 y = c(22, 24, 24, 25, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 36))

#fit simple linear regression model
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
```

And we can use the following code to predict the response value for a new observation:

```{r}
#define new observation
new <- data.frame(x = c(5))
# this has to be a dataframe otherwise it will not work.

#use the fitted model to predict the value for the new observation
predict(model, newdata = new)
```
The model predicts that this new observation will have a response value of $25.36364$.

### Multiple linear regression model

Multiple Linear Regression Model

The following code shows how to fit a multiple linear regression model in R:

```{r}
#create data
df <- data.frame(x1 = c(3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12),
                 x2 = c(6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 14),
                 y = c(22, 24, 24, 25, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 36))

#fit multiple linear regression model
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)
```
And we can use the following code to predict the response value for a new observation:

```{r}
#define new observation
new <- data.frame(x1 = c(5),
                  x2 = c(10))
# here we can see why the predict function has to use a dataframe - because it
# can also be used to predict values of a multiple linear regression model

#use the fitted model to predict the value for the new observation
predict(model, newdata = new)
```
The model predicts that this new observation will have a response value of $26.17073$.

### Plotting a regression model

You can use the R visualization library ggplot2 to plot a fitted linear regression model using the following basic syntax:

  ```
  ggplot(data,aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method='lm')
  ```
The following example shows how to use this syntax in practice.

Suppose we fit a simple linear regression model to the following dataset:

```{r}
#create dataset
data <- data.frame(y = c(6, 7, 7, 9, 12, 13, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 23, 25, 26),
                   x = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 11, 12, 12))

#fit linear regression model to dataset and view model summary
model <- lm(y~x, data = data)
summary(model)
```

```{r}
# make sure to import the ggplot library: library(ggplot2)

#create plot to visualize fitted linear regression model
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, col = "turquoise4") +
  labs(x = 'X Values', y = 'Y Values', title = 'Linear Regression Plot') +
  #this last line makes the title header bold and in the middle
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = 'bold'))
```
Note the `se` argument removes the standard error from the visualization of if it is needed simply remove it or set it to `TRUE`
